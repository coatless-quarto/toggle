Ever wished readers could hide verbose output while keeping the code visible?
The `toggle` extension adds a button to your code blocks that shows or hides
the output on demand.

Think of it as the opposite of Quarto's
[`code-fold`](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-code.html#folding-code).
Instead of hiding code and showing output, Toggle **hides output** and shows code.

## Installation

To install the `toggle` extension, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.

2. Execute the following command:

```bash
quarto add coatless-quarto/toggle
```

This command will download and install the extension under the `_extensions`
subdirectory of your Quarto project. If you are using version control, ensure
that you include this directory in your repository.

### Requirements

- Quarto >= 1.7.0

## Usage

1. **Add the filter** to your document's YAML header:

```yaml
---
title: "My Document"
format: html
filters:
  - toggle
---
```

2. **Enable toggle for specific code cells** by adding `toggle: true`:

````md
```{{python}}
#| toggle: true
print("Hello, Python world!")
```
````

That's it! A toggle button will now appear when you hover over the code block.

Want toggle on every cell? Add `output-toggle: true` at the document level:

```yaml
extensions:
  toggle:
    output-toggle: true
filters:
  - toggle
```

## Options

Set these under `extensions.toggle` or per-cell with `#|` comments:

| Option | Default | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `output-toggle` | `false` | Add toggle buttons to all cells |
| `output-hidden` | `false` | Start with outputs collapsed |
| `output-sync` | `false` | Sync all outputs in a cell together |
| `global-toggle` | `false` | Floating button to toggle everything |
| `persist` | `false` | Remember state across page reloads |
| `button-text` | `"Output"` | Label shown on the button |
