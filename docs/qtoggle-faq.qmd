# General Information

## What is the toggle extension for Quarto?

The `toggle` extension is a Quarto extension that allows you to add toggle
buttons to your code cells. These buttons let readers show or hide the output
of code blocks, making your documents more interactive and less cluttered.

## Does toggle work with all Quarto formats?

This extension works with HTML-based output formats like:

- HTML documents
- Websites
- Books (HTML format)
- Revealjs presentations

It does not affect PDF, Word, or other non-HTML output formats as these
formats don't support the JavaScript functionality needed for toggling.

## How is this different from Quarto's built-in code folding?

Quarto's built-in
[`code-fold`](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-code.html#folding-code)
option toggles visibility of the **code** while always showing the **output**.
This extension does the opposite: it toggles visibility of the **output**
while always showing the **code**.

You can use both features together:

```yaml
format:
  html:
    code-fold: true
extensions:
  toggle:
    output-toggle: true
filters:
  - toggle
```

This gives readers maximum control over what they see.

# Installation

## How do I install the toggle extension?

Run this in your terminal:

```bash
quarto add coatless-quarto/toggle
```

See the [home page](index.qmd) for more details.

## Is the toggle extension compatible with all Quarto versions?

The `toggle` extension requires Quarto v1.7.0 or later.

# Usage

## How do I enable toggle buttons for all code cells?

Add the following to your document's YAML header:

```yaml
extensions:
  toggle:
    output-toggle: true
filters:
  - toggle
```

## Do I need to modify my existing code cells?

If you've enabled toggle at the document level, no changes are needed to your
existing code cells. If you want to control toggle behavior for specific
cells, you'll need to add cell-level attributes.

## How do I toggle output visibility for a specific cell?

Add the `toggle: true` attribute to the cell:

````markdown
```{{python}}
#| toggle: true
print("Hello, world!")
```
````

#### Can I make outputs hidden by default?

Yes, at the document level:

```yaml
extensions:
  toggle:
    output-toggle: true
    output-hidden: true
```

Or at the cell level:

````md
```{{python}}
#| toggle: true
#| output-hidden: true
print("Hello, world!")
```
````

## How do I disable toggle for a specific cell when it's enabled at the document level?

Use the `toggle: false` attribute:

````md
```{{python}}
#| toggle: false
print("This output always shows")
```
````

## What happens if a code cell doesn't produce any output?

If a code cell doesn't produce any output, the toggle button won't appear
even if `toggle: true` is set for that cell.

## What's the difference between individual and synchronized control?

- **Individual** (`output-sync: false`): Each toggle button controls only its
  specific output
- **Synchronized** (`output-sync: true`): Any toggle button controls ALL
  outputs in the cell

Synchronized buttons display a blue left border so readers can tell they're
linked.

#### How do I sync output toggles in multi-output scenarios?

At the document level, set `output-sync: true`:

```yaml
extensions:
  toggle:
    output-toggle: true
    output-sync: true
```

Or at the cell level:

````md
```{{python}}
#| toggle: true
#| output-sync: true
print("Hello, world!")
print("Goodbye, world!")
```
````

## Can I add a button that toggles all outputs at once?

Yes. Enable `global-toggle` to add a floating button in the bottom-right
corner:

```yaml
extensions:
  toggle:
    output-toggle: true
    global-toggle: true
```

This is useful for long documents where clicking each toggle individually
gets tedious.

## Can toggle remember state across page refreshes?

Yes. Enable `persist` to save toggle state to the browser's localStorage:

```yaml
extensions:
  toggle:
    output-toggle: true
    persist: true
```

Each page maintains its own state. Different URLs have separate states.

#### How do I clear saved toggle states?

Open browser DevTools (F12) → Application → Local Storage → delete keys
starting with `quarto-toggle-`.

## Can I customize the button label?

Yes. Use `button-text` to change the label from "Output" to something else:

```yaml
extensions:
  toggle:
    output-toggle: true
    button-text: "Result"
```

Or at the cell level:

````md
```{{python}}
#| toggle: true
#| button-text: "Solution"
print("42")
```
````

## Does toggle work inside tabsets, callouts, or other containers?

Yes. Toggle uses ID-based matching between code blocks and outputs, so it
works regardless of how your cells are nested. You can place code cells inside
tabsets, callouts, columns, `<details>` elements, or any combination.

See the [Nested Containers](qtoggle-nested-containers.qmd) demo for examples.

# Styling

## Does toggle support dark mode?

Yes. It automatically detects `prefers-color-scheme` and Quarto's
`.quarto-dark` class. Button colors adapt automatically.

## How do I customize the appearance?

Override CSS custom properties using the `--tg-*` prefix:

```css
:root {
  /* Button colors */
  --tg-btn-bg: #f0f0f0;
  --tg-btn-bg-hover: #e0e0e0;
  --tg-btn-border: #ccc;
  --tg-btn-text: #333;

  /* Button sizing */
  --tg-btn-radius: 3px;
  --tg-btn-font-size: 0.8rem;
  --tg-btn-padding: 0.2rem 0.5rem;

  /* Other options */
  --tg-sync-indicator: #0066cc;
  --tg-focus-color: #0066cc;
  --tg-output-border-color: #ccc;
  --tg-output-border-style: dashed;
}
```

The extension uses Bootstrap variables as fallbacks when available. See the
[Custom Styling](qtoggle-styling.qmd) guide for full details.

# Troubleshooting

## Why don't I see any toggle buttons?

Check these:

1. `filters: [toggle]` is in your YAML
2. Toggle is enabled (`output-toggle: true` or `toggle: true` on cells)
3. Your cells produce output
4. You're viewing an HTML format

## Why does my button overlap with the copy button?

The extension adjusts automatically. If you still see overlap, add custom CSS:

```css
.code-toggle-btn {
  right: 6rem;
}
```
