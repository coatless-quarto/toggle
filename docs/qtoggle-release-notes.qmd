# 0.0.0-dev.1: ????? (??-??-????)

## Features

- `toggle` extension adds toggle buttons to code cells.
  - Toggles allow readers to show or hide the output of code blocks 
    without affecting the visibility of the code itself.
  - Toggles are added to code cells by setting the `toggle` attribute in the code chunk options or by specifying `output-toggle: true` in the `toggle` key in the YAML header.
  - The output of the code cell is shown by default, but can be hidden by specifying `output-hidden: true` in the code chunk options or under the `toggle` key in the YAML header.
  - Toggles are compatible with HTML-based output formats, including HTML documents, websites, books (HTML format), and Revealjs presentations.
