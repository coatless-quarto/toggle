By default, toggle state resets when you refresh the page. With persistence
enabled, your choices are saved to the browser's localStorage and restored on
your next visit.

## Configuration

Enable persistence in your settings:

```yaml
extensions:
  toggle:
    output-toggle: true
    persist: true
```

Or per-cell with `#| persist: true`.

```{{r}}
#| persist: true
print("This cell's toggle state will be remembered.")
```

## Try It

1. Toggle the output below to hide it
2. Refresh the page
3. Your choice should be preserved

```{r}
cat("Toggle me, then refresh the page.\n")
cat("I'll remember whether I was hidden or shown.\n")
```

## Clearing Saved State

Toggle states are stored in `localStorage` using keys like
`quarto-toggle-/path-cell-0`. Each page maintains its own state. To reset:

1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Application → Local Storage
3. Delete keys starting with `quarto-toggle-`

All data stays in your browser. Nothing is sent to any server.

## Summary

Use `persist: true` to save toggle state in the browser. Useful for documents readers visit repeatedly.
